# Hi there, I'm Hovig 👋

## 🚀 About Me

Tinkerer at heart | Enthusiastic amateur dabbling in infrastructure, automation, and data wrangling. Currently trying to convince computers to do what I want (with varying degrees of success). Learning by breaking things and occasionally fixing them.

🔧 **Enthusiastically tinkering with:**
- 🖥️ Proxmox & Docker *(still googling error messages)*
- 🐧 Linux *(sudo apt-get install patience)*
- 📄 Paperless-ngx *(attempting to digitize my analog chaos)*
- 🎬 Jellyfin *(because I needed ONE more side project)*
- 🤖 AI & Machine Learning *(fascinated by the possibilities, learning the fundamentals)*

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Infrastructure & Systems:**
```
Proxmox VE • Docker • Linux • Bash • Tailscale
(Expertise level: "It works on my machine!")
```

**Development:**
```
PowerQuery & M-Code • SQL • * Python (beginner) • * C# (learning) • * JavaScript (experimenting)
```

**Data & Analytics:**
```
Power BI • Excel Power Query • Data Transformation & Cleaning
```

## 🌱 Currently Working On

- 🎬 **Jellyfin Plugin** - Built a plugin because I was too lazy to add another server and got annoyed with the password-remembering process. Classic programmer move: spend 10 hours automating a 5-minute task.
- 📚 **Document Management** - Trying to organize my real life chaos digitally (spoiler: the digital chaos is just better indexed)
- 🔐 **Data Governance** - Making sense of access rights and compliance requirements
- 🏢 **AGBU Germany** - Helping to organize operations more sustainably and efficiently
- 🤖 **AI Exploration** - Diving into AI/ML concepts and exploring practical applications in governance and automation

## 🤝 Connect With Me

- 📍 Based in Frankfurt, Germany
- 💼 Open to collaborations on infrastructure and open-source projects
- 💬 Always happy to chat about AI, data governance, or why my Docker container won't start
- 📫 Reach out via GitHub issues or discussions

## 🎯 Interests

- 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code *(aspirational)*
- 🤖 AI Governance & Implementation
- 📖 Data Management & Compliance
- 🌐 Self-hosted Solutions *(because why rely on the cloud when you can have your own 3am server emergencies)*
- 👨‍💻 Open Source Contributing
- 🧠 Machine Learning & AI Applications
